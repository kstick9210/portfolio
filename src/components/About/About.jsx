            <hr></hr>
            I'm Kathleen Stickel. I am a detail-oriented and efficiency-minded software engineer based in Dallas, Texas who 
            is highly motivated to overcome obstacles to achieve exceptional results. My experiences as 
            a math tutor for high school students as well as a project leader in the federal government 
            have refined my communication skills and given me a thirst for problem solving. Whether Iâ€™m 
            conducting an intelligence briefing or assisting a team with server-side debugging, I know 
            how to assess a problem from any angle and communicate it concisely.<br></br><br></br>
